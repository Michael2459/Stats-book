In a Jupyter notebook you have two types of cells: text (like this cell) and (Python) code.  The latter have 'In [ ]: next to them and a 'play' button which you click to 'run' the cell, which returns some output (or at least does something).  You can run each cell individually or all of them at once (via the 'Kernel' menu).  While running, and asterisk appears in the [ ], when finished a number appears. If no error message appears, it's worked.  \n",
